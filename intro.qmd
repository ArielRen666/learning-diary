# Week 1 - Introduction to Remote Sensing

## Summary

In my first remote sensing course, I stepped into a world where satellites and sensors act like high-tech scouts, constantly transmitting data about our planet. Seeing how these eyes in the sky capture the world as it is helps us understand everything from urban sprawl to retreating glaciers.

This week's highlights are as follows: Remote sensing - gathering information about the Earth's surface through sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft.
