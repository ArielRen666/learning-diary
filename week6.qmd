# Week 6 - Classification I

## Summary

This week's lecture on "Classification I" immersed me into the intricate world of satellite imagery and Earth observation data, unveiling the power of classifying vast datasets to extract useful insights about our planet. Using remote sensing software, we can effectively sort satellite images into categories like water, wetlands, forests, and urban areas. This process not only aids in identifying land cover types but also in tracking environmental changes and predicting future trends with enhanced accuracy.

### What is Image Classification in Remote Sensing?

The 3 main types of image classification techniques in remote sensing are:

-   Unsupervised image classification
-   Supervised image classification
-   Object-based image analysis

Unsupervised and supervised image classification are the two most common approaches, and also they are the focus of this week.

### Supervised Classification vs. Unsupervised Classification

The table below highlights the differences between unsupervised and supervised classification

|       Aspect        |               Supervised Classification                | Unsupervised Classification                            |
|:----------------:|:---------------------------:|--------------------------|
|     Definition      |   z Classification guided by known training samples     | Classification without predefined training data        |
|    Training Data    |     Requires labeled training data for each class      | No labeled training data required                      |
|       Process       | Involves training the classifier using labeled samples | Involves training the classifier using labeled samples |
|  User Involvement   |        Requires user to select training samples        | Minimal user intervention during classification        |
|  Class Information  |     Prior knowledge of class identities is needed      | Classes are discovered from data patterns              |
| Accuracy Assessment |    Often results in higher accuracy due to training    | May have lower accuracy due to lack of training        |
|    Applicability    |       Effective for identifying specific classes       | Suitable for exploratory data analysis                 |
|     Flexibility     |     Less flexible, as predefined classes are used      | More flexible, as classes are generated dynamically    |
|     Complexity      |    Potentially more complex due to training process    | Generally simpler as it relies on clustering           |

### Supervised Classification in Remote Sensing

In supervised classification, first select representative samples for each land cover class. Then, software uses these “training sites” and applies them to the entire image. The training samples are key because they will determine which class each pixel inherits in the overall image.

The three basic steps for supervised classification are:

1. **Select training areas**: for example, mark urban areas by marking them in the image. Then, continue adding training sites representative in the entire image.

2. **Generate signature file**: for each land cover class, we continue create training samples until we have representative samples for each class. In turn, this would generate a signature file, which stores all training samples’ spectral information.

3. **Classify**: the last step is to use the signature file to run a classification. From here, we have to pick a classification algorithm such as:

- Maximum likelihood
- Minimum-distance
- Principal components
- Support vector machine (SVM)
- Iso cluster

As shown in several studies, SVM is one of the best classification algorithms in remote sensing, but each option has its own advantages ([Pal & Mather, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1080/01431160512331314083)). 

### Unsupervised Classification in Remote Sensing

In unsupervised classification, it first groups pixels into “clusters” based on their properties. Then, classify each cluster with a land cover class. It is the most basic technique.

The two basic steps for unsupervised classification are:

1. **Generate clusters**
2. **Assign classes**

Using remote sensing software, we first create “clusters”. Some of the common image clustering algorithms are:

- K-means
- ISODATA

After picking a clustering algorithm, we need to identify the number of groups we want to generate. For example, we can create 6, 22, or 39 clusters. Fewer clusters have more resembling pixels within groups, with more clusters increase the variability within groups.

To be clear, these are unclassified clusters. The next step is to manually assign land cover classes to each cluster. For example, if we want to classify vegetation and non-vegetation, we can select the clusters that represent them best.

This video below shows how to perform unsupervised image classification in ArcGIS Pro, uses clustering algorithms to group similar pixels in an image without using any prior training data.
