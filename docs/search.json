I have come to realise that I am more of a science thinker, good at maths and passionate about analysing problems through a scientific and rational lens. In addition, throughout my career, I have recognised the limitations that come with being detached from technology and have developed a keen interest in cutting-edge technology and the use of data analysis to solve problems.

It seems pretty cool doesn‚Äôt it, especially when a cute girl operates it. I also hope to use remote sensing in my dissertation to explore new ways of urban resilience and sustainability. I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to explore new areas. I hope to find a balance between my ideals and experiences to become an integrated, interdisciplinary person who can use my background and new skills to address the challenges facing cities today.

    "section": "1.1 Summary",
    "text": "1.1 Summary\nIn my first remote sensing class, I stepped into a world where satellites and sensors act like high-tech scouts, constantly transmitting data about our planet. Seeing how these eyes in the sky capture the world as it is helps us understand everything from urban sprawl to retreating glaciers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs what I learnt this week:\n\n1.1.1 Remote sensing\nGather information about the Earth‚Äôs surface through sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft, which provides information where there are no ground-based measurements.\n\n\n1.1.2 Types of sensors\n\nActive sensors\nThis type of sensor illuminates its target and then measure the reflected light. Imagine the flash of a camera. It brightens its target. Next, it captures the return light. This is the same principle of how active sensors work. They can pass through clouds and work in the dark, such as X-rays, radar (e.g., synthetic aperture radar (SAR), laser radar (LIDAR)), which are commonly used for topographic mapping and forest altitude measurements.\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of an active sensor. Source: Gisgeography.\n\n\n\nPassive sensors\nMeasure reflected light emitted from the sun. When sunlight reflects off the Earth‚Äôs surface, passive sensors capture that light (e.g., the human eye, cameras, and multispectral sensors such as LANDSAT and Sentinel). They capture images by sensing reflected sunlight in the electromagnetic spectrum, which are commonly used in water resource management, climate change monitoring and disaster response.\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of a passive sensor. Source: Gisgeography.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Electromagnetic Waves (EW)\nEW are the core of remote sensing technology, capturing and analyzing energy reflected or emitted by the Earth to discern surface characteristics. This is based on how various materials absorb and reflect different electromagnetic spectrum bands, allowing the identification and classification of surface substances and phenomena through specific bands‚Äô reception. The figure below shows the different types of EV, which are arranged from longest to shortest wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency; and vice versa.\n\n\n\nDiagram of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. Source: NASA Science.\n\n\nIn addition, different wavelengths lead to different colour spectra, which is why we can see coloured images. For example, the blue colour of the sky is mainly due to the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere, which makes shorter wavelengths of blue light scatter more easily than longer wavelengths of light.\nAt sunrise or sunset there is much more atmosphere to pass through so more scattering occurs When the sun‚Äôs angle changes the blue light scatter doesn‚Äôt reach our eyes as the distance is increased. So longer wavelengths (e.g.reds and oranges) reach us.\n\n\n\nWhy the sky is blue. Source: Explaining Science.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Resolution\nResolution plays an important role in the use of sensor data and will vary depending on the orbit of the satellite and the design of the sensor. For any data set, there are four types of resolution that need to be considered:\n\nRadiometric Resolution: the amount of information in each pixel; the higher the radiometric resolution, the more values of information are stored\nSpatial Resolution: the size of the smallest recognisable object in the image\nSpectral Resolution: the ability of the sensor to recognise finer wavelengths - the narrower the range of wavelengths are, the finer the spectral resolution\nTemporal Resolution: the time it takes for the satellite to time it takes to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area\n\n\n\n\nThe same image at different spatial resolutions: (from left to right) 1 m, 10 m, and 30 m. Source: Coast Noaa.\n\n\nWhy not build a sensor that combines high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution? Because it is difficult to combine all of the required functions into a single remote sensor, researchers must make trade-offs, understand the types of data that are more important for the specific field. For example, high temporal resolution is critical when studying weather over time, while higher spectral or spatial resolution is more important when studying seasonal vegetation changes."

In an era of increasing climate change, being able to decipher and use this data for urban planning or disaster response is critical.

    "section": "3.1 Summary",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis remote sensing lesson covers methods of acquiring and processing remote sensing data and how to apply this data to study cities and the environment. It is mainly divided into two parts: (1) corrections (2) data joining and enhancement.\n\n3.1.1 Corrections\nVarious errors that may exist in remote sensing images (e.g., due to factors such as sensors, atmosphere, terrain, etc.) and how to correct them through different techniques.\n\n\n3.1.2 Geometric Correction\nHow can image distortions caused by factors such as shooting angle, terrain, wind speed (if data is obtained from an airplane), and the Earth‚Äôs rotation be addressed? The purpose of geometric correction is to match images with ground control points or other known reference data to ensure spatial accuracy of the images.\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† \nGeometric correction process. Source: Catalyst Earth\n\n\n3.1.3 Atmospheric Correction\nFocuses on eliminating the effects of the atmosphere on satellite or aerial image data to more accurately reflect the actual reflectivity or brightness value of the surface.\nAs solar radiation passes through the atmosphere to reach the Earth‚Äôs surface, and then reflects back to the sensor, it is scattered and absorbed by gases, water droplets, and particulate matter in the atmosphere. This alters the radiation signal that reaches the sensor.\n\nRelative correction, such as DOS and Pseudo-Invariant Features, uses internal image references for correction and is suitable when atmospheric parameters are lacking.\nAbsolute correction, applies atmospheric models like MODTRAN for direct correction.\n\n\n\n\nGF-1 WFV data true color composite map (left: before atmospheric correction; right: after atmospheric correction). Source: Chapter 4 - Atmospheric correction of optical imagery, 2020\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Orthorectification/Topographic Correction\nCorrect image distortions caused by terrain undulations. Specifically, we can use a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to convert remote sensing images from perspective to orthographic projection corrects distortions from terrain variations, such as mountains and buildings. This alignment results in more accurate positioning, clearer textures, and sharper boundaries in images. This can improve the accuracy of satellite data for various applications such as mapping, land cover analysis and gis.\n\n\n\nThematic Mapper scenes before and after topographic correction (composite of band 5, 4 and 3 in red, green and blue). Source: Li et al., 2015\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Radiometric Correction\nInvolves converting digital image data captured by sensors into true ground reflectance values. This process corrects for sensor system errors and atmospheric condition changes and solar irradiance variations. For example, slopes facing the sun and those in shadow may reflect sunlight in completely different ways. This difference can cause these areas to appear with varying brightness or colors in images, which may then be mistakenly classified into different categories (Jenerowicz et al., 2023).\n\n\n3.1.6 Data Joining and Image Enhancements\nThis part gave me an understanding of how image data from different points in time or from different sensors can be effectively joined, and how image quality and visualisation of information can be improved through image enhancement techniques.\nSpecifically, image enhancement methods include contrast enhancement, spatial enhancement (such as filtering and edge enhancement), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction, texture analysis for spatial variation, and image fusion techniques to combine data from multiple sources or sensors and so on.\n\n\n\nInput and output of spatiotemporal data fusion. Source: Zhu et al., 2018\n\n\nThe above image demonstrates a technique for image fusion. On the left, there is a sequence of dense, coarse images with low resolution but high acquisition frequency. In the middle, there are sparse, fine images with high resolution but lower frequency of acquisition. Through spatiotemporal data fusion, a high-resolution and information-rich fine image is synthesized (on the right), effectively combining the advantages of both image types.\n\n\n\nRemote sensing image using false color synthesis technique.

It illustrates three different band combinations emphasizing vegetation (6,5,2), buildings (7,6,4), and a combination for vegetation (5,4,3) and distinguishing land/water (5,6,4). This technique not only improves visual perception but also aids in analyzing and identifying various land cover types."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nMy first remote sensing class took me on an exciting journey as we began to learn how to use technology to view our planet from above, opening a window to a new world perspective, allowing me to see the changes happening around the world without leaving home. The possibilities are endless, from how to track environmental changes, such as the shrinking of glaciers or the growth of cities, and how it can aid in disaster response, giving me a foundational understanding of remote sensing technology.\nAlthough the technology of remote sensing is interesting, it is indeed complex. The course was filled with mind-boggling new terms and concepts that piqued my curiosity. I had a lot to learn about what types of data could be captured, how to analyze it, and the different ways to apply it. In an era of increasing climate change, being able to decipher and use this data for urban planning or disaster response is critical. Although the complexity of remote sensing can feel like a mountain to climb, I believe that with time and practical experience, I will no longer be afraid of it and it will prepare me to make a tangible difference in the world.üòä"

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nThis remote sensing lesson covers methods of acquiring and processing remote sensing data and how to apply this data to study cities and the environment. It is mainly divided into two parts: (1) corrections (2) data joining and enhancement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Corrections\nVarious errors that may exist in remote sensing images (e.g., due to factors such as sensors, atmosphere, terrain, etc.) and how to correct them through different techniques.\n\nGeometric correction: mainly focuses on the coordinate system and distortion of the image\nAtmospheric correction: involves eliminating the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption\nOrthorectification/topographic correction: removes the deformation caused by terrain\nRadiometric correction: focuses on how to convert the digital value of the image into Spectral radiance with actual physical meaning\n\nVarious correction methods required to preprocess remote sensing data. These include\n\n\n\nDiagram of a passive sensor versus an active sensor. Credit: NASA Applied Sciences Remote Sensing Training Program.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Resolution\nResolution plays an important role in the use of sensor data and will vary depending on the orbit of the satellite and the design of the sensor. For any data set, there are four types of resolution that need to be considered:\n\nRadiometric Resolution: the amount of information in each pixel; the higher the radiometric resolution, the more values of information are stored\nSpatial Resolution: the size of the smallest recognisable object in the image\nSpectral Resolution: the ability of the sensor to recognise finer wavelengths - the narrower the range of wavelengths are, the finer the spectral resolution\nTemporal Resolution: the time it takes for the satellite to time it takes to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area\n\nWhy not build a sensor that combines high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution? Because it is difficult to combine all of the required functions into a single remote sensor, researchers must make trade-offs, understand the types of data that are more important for the specific field. For example, high temporal resolution is critical when studying weather over time, while higher spectral or spatial resolution is more important when studying seasonal vegetation changes."

    "text": "5.2 Application\nAfter understanding the basic concepts of remote sensing and related terminology, I began to delve into its application areas, which help us solve many real-world problems.\nFor example, using remote sensing, we can keep a close eye on active volcanoes, looking for any changes in their thermal profiles that might indicate an imminent eruption. This is critical in areas where volcanoes pose a risk to populations and infrastructure and where traditional observation methods are too dangerous.\nAnother impressive application is disaster management. After an earthquake, it is crucial to assess the damage quickly. The use of remote sensing, particularly object-based image classification and change detection, can speed up this process by providing an accurate damage assessment from above. This helps rescuers know where they are most needed, saving precious time and lives.\nIn agriculture, NDVI (Normalised Vegetation Index) is a very useful tool derived from remote sensing. It measures the health of vegetation by comparing the reflectance of near-infrared light (reflected by plants) to red light (absorbed by plants). In this way, farmers can track crop health, manage resources more efficiently, and even predict yields. This only scratches the surface. Remote sensing helps monitor the environment and biodiversity, plan urban and rural infrastructure, manage natural resources, and much more. It is truly an indispensable tool in our toolkit for effective management of the planet and its resources.\nI have to mention that my teacher mentioned a very interesting case study about illegal deforestation in Brazil, which has piqued my great interest in GEE, which I am really looking forward to. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; c7cbe46a7a15f949d1595792616a2ae09174c676"

    "text": "3.2 Applications\nIn exploring the practical areas of this section, two major enhancement technologies that stood out to me were NDVI and PCA. In terms of NDVI, I had first heard about it and mentioned it in my learning diary in the first week, and as for PCA, I had been exposed to it in my quantitative methods course in the last term. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm most curious about both.\n\n3.2.1 NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)\nRatio must be mentioned when referring to NDVI.\nRatio calculation involves dividing the pixel values of one band by the corresponding pixel values of another band, which helps reduce the impacts of factors such as changes in illumination, terrain shadows, etc., thus increasing the accuracy of the analysis. NDVI is a classic example of ratio.\nNDVI assess the condition of vegetation growth by measuring the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs).\n\\[\nNDVI = \\frac{(NIR-Red)}{(NIR+Red)}\n\\] NIR represents the reflectance of the Near-Infrared band, and Red represents the reflectance of the Red band. NDVI values range from -1 to 1. High values of NDVI indicate higher levels of live green vegetation.\n\n\n\nSource: Earthobservatory.Nasa\n\n\nHow do we use NDVI? \nWe see several sectors using NDVI. For example, in agriculture, farmers use NDVI for precision farming and to measure biomass. Whereas, in forestry, foresters use NDVI to quantify forest supply and leaf area index.\nThe below graphics shows the Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) NDVI maps of the San Joaquin Valley region of California on March 10, 2022 and March 13, 2023. The left 2022 map shows the impact on local vegetation after several years of drought. An extremely wet spring in 2023 lead to an early green-up in the valley.\n \nNDVI Maps of the San Joaquin Valley Region, March 2022 and March 2023. Source: USGS\nFurthermore, NASA states that NDVI is a good indicator of drought. When water limits vegetation growth, it has a lower relative NDVI and density of vegetation.\nThe below satellite maps of vegetation show the density of plant growth over the entire globe. Very low values of NDVI (0.1 and below) correspond to barren areas of rock, sand, or snow. Moderate values represent shrub and grassland (0.2 to 0.3), while high values indicate temperate and tropical rainforests (0.6 to 0.8).\n\n\n\nSource: Earthobservatory.Nasa"

    "text": "3.3 Reflection\nI was introduced to the concept of PCA for the first time In the quantitative methods course last term. It is used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets with correlated independent variables. The result allowed me to retain most of the information in the dataset with as few principal components as possible, effectively reducing the size of the dataset while also enhancing interpretability.\nIt may be a bit much to write about these last few weeks because there is a great deal of unfamiliar terms and context to understand for me, who is completely new to the remote sensing journey, and I will try to keep it as concise as possible for the rest of the week!üòÑ However, I firmly believe in the importance of establishing a strong foundation for my future in-depth practice. I also broadened my horizons by searching for information and communicating with others after class, which is very interesting and rewarding. I really enjoy exploring the unknown and enriching myself with new skills.ü•∞"
