    "section": "1.1 Summary",
    "text": "1.1 Summary\nIn my first remote sensing class, I stepped into a world where satellites and sensors act like high-tech scouts, constantly transmitting data about our planet. Seeing how these eyes in the sky capture the world as it is helps us understand everything from urban sprawl to retreating glaciers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs what I learnt this week:\n\n1.1.1 Remote sensing\nGather information about the Earth‚Äôs surface through sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft, which provides information where there are no ground-based measurements.\n\n\n1.1.2 Types of sensors\n\nActive sensors\nEmit electro-entropic magnetic (EM) waves and receive reflected signals, can pass through clouds and work in the dark, such as X-rays, radar (e.g., synthetic aperture radar (SAR), laser radar (LIDAR)), which are commonly used for topographic mapping and forest altitude measurements.\nPassive sensors\nRely on the energy radiated by the sun or the earth itself and do not emit any signals, but only receive the energy reflected back from the light emitted by the sun, (e.g., the human eye, cameras, and multispectral sensors such as those from the LANDSAT series of satellites), which are commonly used in water resource management, climate change monitoring and disaster response.\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of a passive sensor versus an active sensor. Source: Appliedsciences Nasa.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Electromagnetic Waves (EW)\nEW are the core of remote sensing technology, capturing and analyzing energy reflected or emitted by the Earth to discern surface characteristics. This is based on how various materials absorb and reflect different electromagnetic spectrum bands, allowing the identification and classification of surface substances and phenomena through specific bands‚Äô reception. The figure below shows the different types of EV, which are arranged from longest to shortest wavelength. The longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency; and vice versa.\n\n\n\nDiagram of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. Source: NASA Science.\n\n\nIn addition, different wavelengths lead to different colour spectra, which is why we can see coloured images. For example, the blue colour of the sky is mainly due to the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere, which makes shorter wavelengths of blue light scatter more easily than longer wavelengths of light.\nAt sunrise or sunset there is much more atmosphere to pass through so more scattering occurs When the sun‚Äôs angle changes the blue light scatter doesn‚Äôt reach our eyes as the distance is increased. So longer wavelengths (e.g.reds and oranges) reach us.\n\n\n\nWhy the sky is blue. Source: Explaining Science.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Resolution\nResolution plays an important role in the use of sensor data and will vary depending on the orbit of the satellite and the design of the sensor. For any data set, there are four types of resolution that need to be considered:\n\nRadiometric Resolution: the amount of information in each pixel; the higher the radiometric resolution, the more values of information are stored\nSpatial Resolution: the size of the smallest recognisable object in the image\nSpectral Resolution: the ability of the sensor to recognise finer wavelengths - the narrower the range of wavelengths are, the finer the spectral resolution\nTemporal Resolution: the time it takes for the satellite to time it takes to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area\n\n\n\n\nThe same image at different spatial resolutions: (from left to right) 1 m, 10 m, and 30 m. Source: Coast Noaa.\n\n\nWhy not build a sensor that combines high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution? Because it is difficult to combine all of the required functions into a single remote sensor, researchers must make trade-offs, understand the types of data that are more important for the specific field. For example, high temporal resolution is critical when studying weather over time, while higher spectral or spatial resolution is more important when studying seasonal vegetation changes."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis remote sensing lesson covers methods of acquiring and processing remote sensing data and how to apply this data to study cities and the environment. It is mainly divided into two parts: (1) corrections (2) data joining and enhancement.\n\n3.1.1 Corrections\nVarious errors that may exist in remote sensing images (e.g., due to factors such as sensors, atmosphere, terrain, etc.) and how to correct them through different techniques.\n\n\n3.1.2 Geometric Correction\nHow can image distortions caused by factors such as shooting angle, terrain, wind speed (if data is obtained from an airplane), and the Earth‚Äôs rotation be addressed? The purpose of geometric correction is to match images with ground control points or other known reference data to ensure spatial accuracy of the images.\n\n¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† \nGeometric correction process. Source: Catalyst Earth\n\n\n3.1.3 Atmospheric Correction\nReduces the impact of atmospheric scattering and absorption on image quality through both relative and absolute methods.\n\nRelative correction, such as DOS and Pseudo-Invariant Features, uses internal image references for correction and is suitable when atmospheric parameters are lacking.\nAbsolute correction, applies atmospheric models like MODTRAN for direct correction to obtain the true reflectance of the surface.\n\nThe choice of the appropriate correction method depends on application requirements and data conditions, with the goal of enhancing the accuracy and usability of remote sensing data.\n\n\n\nGF-1 WFV data true color composite map (left: before atmospheric correction; right: after atmospheric correction). Source: Chapter 4 - Atmospheric correction of optical imagery, 2020\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Orthorectification/Topographic Correction\nCorrect image distortions caused by terrain undulations. Specifically, the height of mountains, buildings, and other topographic features can cause positional shifts in images, particularly around the edges. Converting remote sensing images from perspective to orthographic projection, using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), aligns pixels with their true ground positions, essential for map accuracy and terrain analysis.\n\n\n\nTM scenes before and after topographic correction (composite of band 5, 4 and 3 in red, green and blue). Source: Li et al., 2015\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Radiometric Correction\nInvolves converting digital image data captured by sensors into true ground reflectance values. This process corrects for sensor system errors and atmospheric condition changes, like solar irradiance variations. Ensuring data comparability across different sensors and times is essential for analyses such as vegetation monitoring and land cover classification.\n\n\n3.1.6 Data Joining and Enhancement\nThis part gave me an understanding of how image data from different points in time or from different sensors can be effectively joined, and how image quality and visualisation of information can be improved through image enhancement techniques.\n\n\n\nInput and output of spatiotemporal data fusion. Source: Zhu et al., 2018\n\n\nThe above image demonstrates a technique for image fusion. On the left, there is a sequence of dense, coarse images with low resolution but high acquisition frequency. In the middle, there are sparse, fine images with high resolution but lower frequency of acquisition. Through spatiotemporal data fusion, a high-resolution and information-rich fine image is synthesized (on the right), effectively combining the advantages of both image types.\nSpecifically, image enhancement methods include contrast enhancement, spatial enhancement (such as filtering and edge enhancement), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction, texture analysis for spatial variation, and image fusion techniques to combine data from multiple sources or sensors (e.g., through feathering edge techniques)."

The possibilities are endless, from how to track environmental changes, such as the shrinking of glaciers or the growth of cities, and how it can aid in disaster response, giving me a foundational understanding of remote sensing technology.\nAlthough the technology of remote sensing is interesting, it is indeed complex. The course was filled with mind-boggling new terms and concepts that piqued my curiosity. I had a lot to learn about what types of data could be captured, how to analyze it, and the different ways to apply it. In an era of increasing climate change, being able to decipher and use this data for urban planning or disaster response is critical. Although the complexity of remote sensing can feel like a mountain to climb, I believe that with time and practical experience, I will no longer be afraid of it and it will prepare me to make a tangible difference in the world.üòä"

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nThis remote sensing lesson covers methods of acquiring and processing remote sensing data and how to apply this data to study cities and the environment. It is mainly divided into two parts: (1) corrections (2) data joining and enhancement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Corrections\nVarious errors that may exist in remote sensing images (e.g., due to factors such as sensors, atmosphere, terrain, etc.) and how to correct them through different techniques.\n\nGeometric correction: mainly focuses on the coordinate system and distortion of the image\nAtmospheric correction: involves eliminating the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption\nOrthorectification/topographic correction: removes the deformation caused by terrain\nRadiometric correction: focuses on how to convert the digital value of the image into Spectral radiance with actual physical meaning\n\nVarious correction methods required to preprocess remote sensing data. These include\n\n\n\nDiagram of a passive sensor versus an active sensor. Credit: NASA Applied Sciences Remote Sensing Training Program.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Resolution\nResolution plays an important role in the use of sensor data and will vary depending on the orbit of the satellite and the design of the sensor. For any data set, there are four types of resolution that need to be considered:\n\nRadiometric Resolution: the amount of information in each pixel; the higher the radiometric resolution, the more values of information are stored\nSpatial Resolution: the size of the smallest recognisable object in the image\nSpectral Resolution: the ability of the sensor to recognise finer wavelengths - the narrower the range of wavelengths are, the finer the spectral resolution\nTemporal Resolution: the time it takes for the satellite to time it takes to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area\n\nWhy not build a sensor that combines high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution? Because it is difficult to combine all of the required functions into a single remote sensor, researchers must make trade-offs, understand the types of data that are more important for the specific field. For example, high temporal resolution is critical when studying weather over time, while higher spectral or spatial resolution is more important when studying seasonal vegetation changes."

    "section": "5.2 Application",
    "text": "5.2 Application\nAfter understanding the basic concepts of remote sensing and related terminology, I began to delve into its application areas, which help us solve many real-world problems.\nFor example, using remote sensing, we can keep a close eye on active volcanoes, looking for any changes in their thermal profiles that might indicate an imminent eruption. This is critical in areas where volcanoes pose a risk to populations and infrastructure and where traditional observation methods are too dangerous.\nAnother impressive application is disaster management. After an earthquake, it is crucial to assess the damage quickly. The use of remote sensing, particularly object-based image classification and change detection, can speed up this process by providing an accurate damage assessment from above. This helps rescuers know where they are most needed, saving precious time and lives.\nIn agriculture, NDVI (Normalised Vegetation Index) is a very useful tool derived from remote sensing. It measures the health of vegetation by comparing the reflectance of near-infrared light (reflected by plants) to red light (absorbed by plants). In this way, farmers can track crop health, manage resources more efficiently, and even predict yields. This only scratches the surface. Remote sensing helps monitor the environment and biodiversity, plan urban and rural infrastructure, manage natural resources, and much more. It is truly an indispensable tool in our toolkit for effective management of the planet and its resources.\nI have to mention that my teacher mentioned a very interesting case study about illegal deforestation in Brazil, which has piqued my great interest in GEE, which I am really looking forward to. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; c7cbe46a7a15f949d1595792616a2ae09174c676"
