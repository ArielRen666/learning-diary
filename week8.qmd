# Week 8 - SAR

## Summary

Last week, we mentioned that supervised and unsupervised classification is pixel-based. In other words, it creates square pixels and each pixel has a class. Today we dive into higher level image classification techniques- object-based image analysis. In addition, this week also covers sub pixel classification, accuracy assessment and cross-validation.

### Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)

OBIA Groups pixels into representative vector shapes with size and geometry. It doesn’t create single pixels. Instead, it generates objects with different geometries. If you have the right image, objects can be so meaningful that it does the digitizing for you. For example, the segmentation results below highlight buildings.

Four steps to perform OBIA classification:

1.  Perform multiresolution segmentation
2.  Select training areas
3.  Define statistics
4.  Classify

In OBIA classification, we can use different methods to classify objects. For example,

-   **shape**: if we want to classify buildings, we can use a shape statistic such as “rectangular fit”. This tests an object’s geometry to the shape of a rectangle.

-   **texture**: homogeneity of an object. For example, water is mostly homogeneous because it’s mostly dark blue. But forests have shadows and are a mix of green and black.

-   **spectral**: we can use the mean value of spectral properties such as near-infrared, short-wave infrared, red, green, or blue.

-   **geographic context**: objects have proximity and distance relationships between neighbors.

-   **Nearest neighbor (NN) classification**: similar to supervised classification

### How to decide which image classification technique to use?

Let’s say we want to classify trees in high spatial resolution image.

We decide to choose all pixels with high NDVI in that image. But this could also misclassify other pixels in the image that aren’t trees. For this reason, pixel-based classification like unsupervised and supervised classification gives a "salt and pepper" look, which means image appears to be speckled with noise or granular variations.

Humans naturally aggregate spatial information into groups. Multiresolution segmentation does this task by grouping homogenous pixels into objects. Water features are easily recognizable after multiresolution segmentation. This is how humans visualize spatial features.

**So, when should we use pixel-based (unsupervised and supervised classification) or object-based classification?**

As I illustrated before, spatial resolution is an important factor when selecting image classification techniques. When we have a low spatial resolution image, both traditional pixel-based and object-based image classification techniques perform well. In contrast, when we have a high spatial resolution image, OBIA is superior to traditional pixel-based classification.

### Sub-pixel Analysis

Sub-pixel means that each pixel will be divided into smaller units to implement interpolation algorithms for these smaller units.

Sub-pixel mapping, which in most cases can be regarded as a subsequent procedure to spectral unmixing, aims to arrange the spatial location of possible classes inside each mixed pixel given the obtained abundance map.

The goal of sub-pixel analysis is to extract more detailed information at the pixel level. For example, even if a pixel is primarily covered by buildings, if it also includes a portion of roads and vegetation, sub-pixel analysis will be able to identify these proportions. This is particularly useful for urban planning and environmental monitoring, as it allows for more precise mapping and monitoring of urban land use and changes.

### Accuracy Assessment

Confusion Matrix is a fundamental tool for assessing the performance of classification models in machine learning and statistics. It provides a visual representation of the actual vs. predicted outcomes for a binary classifier, helping to understand how well the model performs in distinguishing between two classes (e.g., spam vs. non-spam in email filtering).





## Applications

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology is widely applied in change detection in real-world scenarios, including disaster assessment, urban development planning, agricultural development, environmental monitoring and other fields.

### Disaster Assessment

After the devastating explosion in Beirut's port area on August 4, 2020, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology played a crucial role in assessing the extent of the damage. Scientists utilized satellite radar imagery to create damage proxy maps, which helped identify areas needing immediate assistance. The dark red pixels on these maps indicated the most severe damage, while orange and yellow areas represented moderately or partially damaged zones. This mapping was crucial for guiding emergency response and relief efforts, illustrating the power of SAR technology in disaster situations.

### Urban Expansion Monitoring

As the pace of global urbanization accelerates, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data plays a crucial role in monitoring and planning urban development. By analyzing a series of continuous SAR images, it is possible to track the expansion of urban boundaries, growth of buildings, and changes in urban green spaces. In a 2020 study, researchers utilized multi-temporal SAR data to analyze the urban expansion of Guangzhou, China. This study demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of SAR technology in monitoring the process of urbanization ([Guo et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13052944)).

### Agricultural Development

The application of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology in agricultural monitoring encompasses multiple aspects, including estimation of crop planting area, monitoring of crop growth, and measurement of soil moisture. For instance, in some regions of Africa, SAR is used to monitor crop conditions and estimate yields, especially during the rainy season when cloud cover renders traditional optical satellite data inaccessible. This information is crucial for food security assessments and optimizing irrigation management plans. By analyzing SAR data, it was possible to successfully predict the wheat yield in Australia, providing a new monitoring tool for global agricultural production.

### Environmental Change Monitoring

SAR data is highly effective for monitoring environmental changes, such as deforestation, wetland changes, and glacier retreat. SAR images provide continuous data on surface coverage and terrain changes, which is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change. For example, a recent study used SAR technology to monitor changes in the Amazon rainforest in South America. By comparing SAR images from different times, researchers were able to accurately quantify the extent of deforestation and degradation.
