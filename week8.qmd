# Week 8 - SAR

## Summary

The main focus of this week is about Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). SAR is an emerging technology in remote sensing. In fact, Sentinel-1 is equipped with this active type of sensor, which I have discussed in [week2's learning diary](https://arielren666.github.io/learning-diary/week2.html). Likewise, Radarsat and TerraSAR use synthetic aperture radar. The main advantage of this technology is that it can synthetically produce higher-resolution images in any weather condition and even at night.

### SAR‚Äôs Bat-Like Capabilities

It‚Äôs said that synthetic aperture radar is similar to how bats use echolocation to navigate in a cave.

When bats fly in a cave, they use sound to navigate. Generally, they create sound waves from 50 to 120 dB. When this sound bounces off a wall and returns to the bat, it understands distance based on the echo.

In general, the same principles apply to SAR. The satellite sends microwave pulses to Earth. The pulse returns back to the satellite and the sensor makes an image from the returned echoes.

Generally, synthetic aperture radar is side-looking. This means they don‚Äôt look completely down at Nadir but at an angle. There are advantages to this type of viewing angle which I will mention below.

As mentioned earlier, microwave radar can be seen at night and through clouds and smoke. At any time of the day or in any type of weather condition, SAR works.

Actually, longer wavelengths can penetrate clouds better and even the ground. For example, L-band (~24 cm) radar has longer wavelengths than C-band (~6 cm) and X-band (~3cm).

### Types of Radar Scattering

Side-looking radar interacts with different types of terrain. The 3 main types of scattering mechanisms are:

- Specular
- Diffuse
- Double-bounce

### SAR Image Interpretation

Now that we know the basics of synthetic aperture radar, let‚Äôs look at a SAR image with these types of scattering. In this Radarsat-2 example, the image clearly shows all three types of backscatter.

### Diffuse Scattering

Finally, the majority of the radar image is rough surface scattering. You have a bit of specular and double-bounce scattering.

This may be from annual cropland, vegetation, grasses, or other features. It is diffuse scattering because there‚Äôs not a high or low amount of backscatter in the image.

## Applications

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology is widely applied in change detection in real-world scenarios, including disaster assessment, urban development planning, agricultural development, environmental monitoring and other fields.

### Disaster Assessment

After the devastating explosion in Beirut's port area on August 4, 2020, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology played a crucial role in assessing the extent of the damage. Scientists utilized satellite radar imagery to create damage proxy maps, which helped identify areas needing immediate assistance. The dark red pixels on these maps indicated the most severe damage, while orange and yellow areas represented moderately or partially damaged zones. This mapping was crucial for guiding emergency response and relief efforts, illustrating the power of SAR technology in disaster situations.

### Urban Expansion Monitoring

As the pace of global urbanization accelerates, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data plays a crucial role in monitoring and planning urban development. By analyzing a series of continuous SAR images, it is possible to track the expansion of urban boundaries, growth of buildings, and changes in urban green spaces. In a 2020 study, researchers utilized multi-temporal SAR data to analyze the urban expansion of Guangzhou, China. This study demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of SAR technology in monitoring the process of urbanization ([Guo et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/su13052944)).

### Agricultural Development

The application of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology in agricultural monitoring encompasses multiple aspects, including estimation of crop planting area, monitoring of crop growth, and measurement of soil moisture. For instance, in some regions of Africa, SAR is used to monitor crop conditions and estimate yields, especially during the rainy season when cloud cover renders traditional optical satellite data inaccessible. This information is crucial for food security assessments and optimizing irrigation management plans. By analyzing SAR data, it was possible to successfully predict the wheat yield in Australia, providing a new monitoring tool for global agricultural production.

### Environmental Change Monitoring

SAR data is highly effective for monitoring environmental changes, such as deforestation, wetland changes, and glacier retreat. SAR images provide continuous data on surface coverage and terrain changes, which is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change. For example, a recent study used SAR technology to monitor changes in the Amazon rainforest in South America. By comparing SAR images from different times, researchers were able to accurately quantify the extent of deforestation and degradation.
