# Week 5 - Introduction to GEE

## Summary

This week I stepped into a whole new world, GEE (Google Earth Engine), which is a cloud-based platform that delivers a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery for planetary-scale analysis.

**It's an incredible resource for anyone who wants to explore the world through satellite imagery.**

We can not only gain access to remote sensing data from satellites, airborne, digital elevation models, but also we can turn this geospatial data into actionable insights through the platform’s fast computations and 1000+ types of operators for analysis.

And the most important is that **it’s completely free**!!!

From land use to weather data, it’s through its vast (and growing) catalog of remote sensing data that we can see the world through a different lens. We can have access to many key datasets on this platform, such as Landsat (30m), Sentinel-2 (10-30m), MODIS (250m daily), Sentinel-1 (Radar), Land cover, Weather and Climate (NOAA) and so on.

**Let's step into the world of GEE and see how amazing it is!**

### What Can Google Earth Engine Do?

GEE tackles the challenge of open analysis in remote sensing with a focus on getting results. It’s able to avoid any bottlenecks because it’s able to adjust the size of its clusters based on how much demand there is for a data product.

### Geospatial Processing Functions

GEE contains more than 1000 data types and operators to help lay a solid foundation for any type of remote sensing analysis.

In addition to these analysis tools, there are other specialty types of algorithms. For instance, cloud and shadow filtering algorithms help remove artifacts so we can focus your analysis on the Earth’s surface.

But one of the most exciting areas of development in GEE is a shift to machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. For example, (1) **SVM** (2) **Random forests** (3) **K-Means** (4) **CART**

### How to get started?

Isn't it amazing and powerful! I can't wait to operate it after hearing all this. If you want to learn how to do it, but are a complete beginner like me, I found the video below very helpful.

## Applications

### GEE Web Application Examples

On GEE's homepage we can see that there are six curated applications, from time-lapse imagery to global forest change web maps. Each one demonstrates its powerful computing and how it can lead to making informed decisions for the environment.

-   **Ocean Timelapse**: one of the most powerful features of GEE is its vast amount of temporal data. With over 35+ years of imagery, it’s like we’re traveling back in time on an interactive map of the ocean.

-   **Linked Maps**: shows separate viewports with different band combinations. While the natural color is similar to what the human eye sees, the color-infrared, Land/Water, and Vegetation viewport highlights other land use features.

-   **Split Panel**: contains a slider with two separate images side-by-side. We can compare two images from different dates beside each other to easily check for the differences between them.

-   **Collection Mosaic**: allows us to select from a group of Landsat-8 images, and based on it, the app will generate a mosaic using the median values.

-   **Global Population Explorer**: after selecting a country, it dynamically creates a graph or table with the population density of that country.

-   **Global Forest Change**: shows the results of global forest change using Landsat imagery between 2000 and 2016. We can interactively pan and zoom around in app and can symbolize deforestation based on the year of the loss or by the percent of tree cover.

### Monitoring Global Forest Changes

The most impressive application of GEE to me is illegal deforestation in Brazil. The teacher mentioned this very interesting case in the first week class, which aroused my great interest in GEE at that time.

Forests are critical ecosystems for fighting climate change, supporting livelihoods and protecting biodiversity.

Due to its vast forest resources, Brazil has always been targeted by international and domestic loggers, leading to massive human-induced destruction of the Amazon rainforest. In the past, illegal loggers took advantage of the limitations of technology and monitoring to avoid detection and prosecution. They carefully planned to cut down areas smaller than one square kilometer to escape monitoring at the kilometer resolution.

However, the emergence of GEE changed all. To create the global forest map, GEE used a network of cloud-based servers to process 650,000 images across 10,000 computers working in parallel. It would have taken a solo computer 15 years to do the job.

GEE's 30-meter high resolution ensures that even the smallest environmental changes are detectable, greatly increasing the ability to detect illegal logging activities. As a result, about 100 lawsuits due to illegal logging were filed in just one year, compared to almost none in the previous 20 years.

Now, with the application below, we can easily access the global forest map, monitor forest changes in real time, and effectively expose and combat illegal logging activities.

## Reflection

The rapid advancement of technology is changing our lives and the world at an unprecedented pace, also providing innovative means to solve some long-standing issues. GEE stands out as a pivotal tool for environmental and geospatial analysis, revolutionizing how we address and solve critical environmental issues.

Reflecting on the week's lessons in remote sensing, GEE combines satellite imagery and geospatial data with powerful computing to help people and organizations understand how the planet is changing, how human activity contributes to those changes and what actions they can take.

Such technological advancements have piqued my curiosity, making me even more interested in delving into this course. By mastering these technologies, we can not only better protect our environment but also solve seemingly intractable problems in many other fields. What an exciting era this is!
