# Week 2 - Presentation of Sentinel-1

## Summary

This week's lecture on "Classification I" immersed me into the intricate world of satellite imagery and Earth observation data, unveiling the power of classifying vast datasets to extract useful insights about our planet. Using remote sensing software, we can effectively sort satellite images into categories like water, wetlands, forests, and urban areas. This process not only aids in identifying land cover types but also in tracking environmental changes and predicting future trends with enhanced accuracy.
